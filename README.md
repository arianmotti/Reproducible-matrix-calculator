# Reproducible-matrix-calculator
The input format of the program is such that in the first input line, it takes the number of repetitions of the requested operation (n), then in the next line, the number of rows (r) and column (c) of the first matrix are entered, respectively, and in r the next line In each line, c is a number that represents the rows of the first matrix; after receiving the first matrix, in the next line, the number of rows and columns of the second matrix is ​​given, and in the following lines, the numbers of the second matrix are given as the first matrix. To be. In the next line, one of the three expressions + or - or * appears, which specifies what operation should be performed on these two matrices.
After receiving the type of matrix operation, the program must perform the required operation between these two matrices; Then replace the first matrix with the result obtained and perform n times (the number given on the first input line) the same operation as this between the last result matrix (as the first matrix) and the second matrix (on the input data matrix). Was done) and finally output the result matrix (each row in a line).
